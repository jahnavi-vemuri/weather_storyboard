# weather_storyboard

I obtained weather data from Open Weather and used their API. 

For this, you’ll need to sign up and confirm your account. Once you do all that, you’ll receive an API Key which you’ll use to fetch the data through API calls. 

Use the search view controller to get the input (city name) from the user. 

Fetch the weather data of the city. 

Data has to be displayed in the display view controller. 
The data fetched includes:
Lon and Lat 
Temp 
Pressure 
Wind speed 
Country

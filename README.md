# weather_storyboard

This app is written in Swift using Storyboard for UI in Xcode.

I obtained weather data from Open Weather and used their API. 

For this, I signed up and confirmed account. Once I did all that, I received an API Key which I used to fetch the data through API calls using Almofire.

Used the search view controller to get the input (city name) from the user. 

Fetched the weather data of the city. 

Data is been displayed in the display view controller. 
The data fetched includes:
Lon and Lat,
Temp,
Pressure, 
Wind speed, 
Country. 

No of screens - 2:
Search screen,
Weather data screen
